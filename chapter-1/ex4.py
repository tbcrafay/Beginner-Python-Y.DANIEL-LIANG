print("a\t\t\t a^2 \t\t\t a^3")

for num in range(1,5,1):
    print(num,"\t\t\t",num**2,"\t\t\t",num**3)
    
''' again don't be worried about the code (for num in...), as you will learn that in further chapters. Just consider that i didnt want to write the numbers 1 by 1. 
what you can do is this:
print(1,"\t\t\t",1**2,"\t\t\t",1**3)
print(2,"\t\t\t",2**2,"\t\t\t",2**3) and so on... '''
